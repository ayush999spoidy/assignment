In simple terms, an SVM tries to find the best hyperplane (a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, and so on) that separates data points of different classes with the largest margin. The data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. This makes SVMs effective in high-dimensional spaces and robust to outliers."
