        "Inefficient Estimates: When heteroscedasticity is present, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of the regression coefficients are still unbiased, but they are no longer efficient. This means that they have larger variances and are less precise. In other words, the estimated relationships between the predictors and the outcome variable might not be as accurate as they could be.\n",
        "Unreliable Standard Errors: Heteroscedasticity can lead to unreliable standard errors for the regression coefficients. Standard errors are used to calculate confidence intervals and p-values for hypothesis testing. When standard errors are unreliable, it can lead to incorrect conclusions about the statistical significance of the predictors. You might incorrectly conclude that a predictor is significant when it's not, or vice versa.\n",
        "Misleading Hypothesis Tests: Hypothesis tests in linear regression rely on the assumption of homoscedasticity. When this assumption is violated, the results of hypothesis tests can be misleading. This can lead to incorrect inferences about the relationships between the variables.\n",
        "Inaccurate Predictions: Heteroscedasticity can also affect the accuracy of predictions made by the regression model. When the variance of the errors is not constant, the model may be more likely to make larger errors for certain values of the predictors. This means that your model's predictions might be less reliable for some parts of your data."
